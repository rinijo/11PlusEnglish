# 11+ GL Comprehension Masterclass

## Module 1 — Figures of Speech & Language Devices (with Effects)

### 1. What are Figures of Speech?

Explain: *“Figures of speech are special ways authors use words to create strong images, feelings, or emphasis. They make the writing more powerful and help readers picture or understand ideas better.”*

### 2. Why Important?

GL questions often ask: *“How does the writer make the scene \[tense, funny, frightening]?”* Children must be able to **spot the device** and **explain its effect**.

### 3. Key Devices with Explanations & Examples

* **Simile**: A comparison using *like* or *as*.
  *Example*: “Her smile shone **like** the sun.” → Makes the image vivid.
* **Metaphor**: Saying one thing *is* another.
  *Example*: “The classroom **was** a zoo.” → Suggests chaos and noise.
* **Personification**: Giving human actions to objects/ideas.
  *Example*: “The wind **whispered** through the trees.” → Creates atmosphere.
* **Alliteration**: Repetition of the same starting sound.
  *Example*: “**S**ilent **s**hadows **s**tole **s**oftly.” → Adds rhythm and drama.
* **Onomatopoeia**: Words that imitate sounds.
  *Example*: “**Bang! Crash! Whoosh!**” → Reader can almost hear the scene.
* **Hyperbole**: Exaggeration to show strong feelings.
  *Example*: “I’ve told you a **million** times!” → Shows frustration.
* **Repetition / Rule of Three**: Repeating words or ideas for impact.
  *Example*: “He came, he saw, he conquered.” → Emphasises power.
* **Rhetorical Question**: A question asked for effect, not an answer.
  *Example*: “Who wouldn’t be frightened?” → Makes the reader think.
* **Imagery (sensory detail)**: Language appealing to senses.
  *Example*: “The bitter scent of smoke scratched her throat.” → Strong sensory detail.
* **Symbolism**: Using something to represent an idea.
  *Example*: “A wilting flower” → Symbolises weakness or decline.
* **Contrast/Juxtaposition/Oxymoron**: Putting opposites together.
  *Example*: “Deafening silence.” → Creates dramatic effect.
* **Sound devices**: Assonance, consonance, sibilance.
  *Example*: “**S**oft **s**ighs” (sibilance) → Creates calm or eerie mood.

### 4. Answer Frames

* “The writer uses **\[device]** (‘**quote**’) to show **\[effect]**.”
* “This **\[device]** emphasises **\[idea]**, making the scene feel **\[emotion]**.”

### 5. Practice Activities

* Spot the device in 5 sentences.
* Rewrite *“The rain fell”* in 3 ways (simile, metaphor, onomatopoeia).
* Explain the effect of “The fire crackled and hissed.”

## Module 2 — Inference & Deduction (Reading Between the Lines)

### 1. What is Inference?

Explain: *“Inference means working out something that the author doesn’t say directly. You become a detective, looking for clues in the text to figure out what characters feel, think, or why events happen.”*

### 2. Why Important?

Many GL questions test inference. Children must not guess wildly, but back up answers with **evidence from the text**.

### 3. How to Infer

* Look at **actions**: *“He shuffled his feet and looked away.”* → He feels nervous.
* Look at **dialogue**: *“I suppose… if I must,” she said reluctantly.* → She doesn’t want to.
* Look at **descriptions**: *“Dark clouds gathered and the wind howled.”* → Suggests something bad is coming.

### 4. Step-by-Step Method

1. Underline the keywords in the question (who/why/what feeling?).
2. Find the sentence/paragraph linked to it.
3. Look for small clues (verbs, adverbs, tone).
4. Make a conclusion.
5. Prove it: *“I think… because the text says…”*.

### 5. Common Mistakes

* Guessing without text evidence.
* Picking details from the wrong part of the passage.
* Adding outside knowledge instead of sticking to the text.

### 6. Practice Activities

* Short sentences → child works out the emotion.
* Mini passages (80–100 words) with 2–3 inference questions.
* Answer every inference with *because + quote*.

## Module 3 — Main Idea & Summarising

### 1. What is the Main Idea?

Explain: *“It’s the most important point of the paragraph. All other sentences give more information about it.”*

### 2. Why Important?

GL papers often ask: *“Which of these sentences best summarises paragraph 2?”* If children can find the main idea, they will answer these quickly.

### 3. How to Find It

* Ask: *“What is this paragraph mostly about?”*
* Ignore extra details, examples, or explanations.
* Look for the **topic sentence** (often at the start).

### 4. Examples

* Paragraph: *“Dogs are loyal companions. They protect their owners and bring joy. Many families keep dogs as pets.”*
  → Main idea: *Dogs are valued family pets.*
* Paragraph: *“In 1969, humans first walked on the Moon. The astronauts faced dangers and solved many problems. Their journey was a huge scientific achievement.”*
  → Main idea: *The Moon landing was a major achievement despite challenges.*

### 5. Strategies

* **One-sentence rule**: Can you explain the whole paragraph in one sentence?
* **Headline test**: Imagine this paragraph was a news story. What headline would fit?
* **Elimination**: In MCQs, remove options that are too narrow (detail only) or too broad (covering the whole text, not just one paragraph).

### 6. Practice Activities

* Give 3 paragraphs; write the main idea of each.
* Provide 4 multiple-choice options; pick the best summary.
* Give a 5-sentence paragraph; child reduces it to 1 sentence.

## Module 4 — Author’s Purpose & Viewpoint

**Why authors write:**

* To **inform** (encyclopedia, news).
* To **persuade** (advert, speech).
* To **entertain** (story, poem).
* To **instruct** (manual, recipe).

**How to tell:** Look for facts, opinions, or instructions. Spot persuasive tricks (emotive words, rhetorical questions).

**Practice:** Take 4 short extracts and label their purpose. Rewrite one factual extract in a persuasive style.

---

## Module 5 — Types of Texts

Children must recognise different styles:

* **Fiction**: characters, settings, conflict.
* **Poetry**: rhyme, rhythm, imagery.
* **Non-fiction**: facts, headings, topic sentences.
* **Persuasive**: slogans, emotive words, rhetorical questions.
* **Instructional**: steps, commands, diagrams.
* **Biographical**: key life events, influences.
* **Reference**: concise facts, categories.

**Teaching tip:** Rotate text types weekly.

## Module 6 — Question Types & How to Tackle Them

### Common GL Questions

* **Retrieval (Find & copy):** Scan for keywords, copy exactly.
* **Vocabulary in context:** Replace with synonyms, check what fits.
* **Inference:** Look for hidden clues, always give evidence.
* **Writer’s technique:** Spot device, explain effect.
* **Main idea/Summary:** Pick answer covering whole paragraph.
* **True/False/Not Given:** True = in text, False = opposite, NG = not mentioned.
* **Sequencing:** Use time words, order events.
* **Comparison:** Use phrases *both / however / whereas*.
* **Opinion/Explanation:** Always justify with text evidence.

### Command Words Checklist

Compare | Contrast | Explain fully | Effective | Summary | Purpose | Function | Impression | Atmosphere | Select | Sequence | Quotations | Statement | Phrase | Technique | React

## Module 7 — Speed & Accuracy

* **Look at questions first** (so you know what to hunt for).
* **Skim** the passage (2–3 minutes) for overall sense.
* **Scan** for keywords in each question.
* **Flag and move on** if stuck (guess, come back later).
* **No negative marking** – don’t leave blanks.

**Accuracy tips:** Underline keywords, quote proof, eliminate wrong answers.

## Module 8 — Practical Activities

* **Spot the Device**: Highlight similes, metaphors, personification.
* **Inference Detective**: Guess feelings from actions.
* **Speed Races**: Find facts quickly.
* **Summary Challenge**: Shrink 5 sentences into 1.
* **Question Hunt**: Show a question, child races to find it in text.
