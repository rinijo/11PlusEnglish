# ✏️ Module 2 – Inference & Deduction  
*(Printable Worksheet in Markdown)*

---

## Instructions  
This worksheet will help you practise **inference** – working out what the author means but doesn’t say directly.  
- Be a **detective**: look for clues in actions, words, or descriptions.  
- Always answer with **evidence from the text**.  
- Use this frame if you are stuck:  
  *“I think [idea] because the text says ‘[quote]’.”*  

---

## Part A: Spot the Feeling  
Read each sentence. What can you **infer** about the character’s feelings? Write your answer with proof.  

1. Sam shuffled his feet and stared at the floor.  
   → ___________________________________________  

2. “Oh… fine, whatever,” muttered Lucy, crossing her arms.  
   → ___________________________________________  

3. Ben checked the clock every few seconds and tapped his fingers.  
   → ___________________________________________

## Part B: Short Paragraphs  
Read the mini-paragraphs. Answer the questions by inferring from the clues.  

**1.**  
The door creaked open and Mia peeked inside. Her hands trembled as she stepped into the room, glancing over her shoulder.  
- How is Mia feeling?  
- What clues tell you this?  

**2.**  
James slammed his book shut and pushed his chair back with a screech. He stomped out without saying a word.  
- How is James feeling?  
- What evidence supports this?  

**3.**  
The puppy wagged its tail furiously, bouncing around the garden and licking everyone’s hands.  
- What can we tell about the puppy’s mood?  
- What words helped you decide?

## Part C: Why Did They Do That?  
Answer the questions using inference.  

1. Sarah refused the cake, even though it was her favourite.  
   → Why might she have refused? ____________________  

2. The boy pulled his coat tighter and hurried along the street.  
   → Why did he do this? ___________________________  

---

## Part D: Mini-Passage Practice  
Read the passage and answer the questions.  

**Passage:**  
The sky darkened and thunder rumbled in the distance. Emma pulled her blanket tighter and turned the page of her book quickly. She bit her lip as the wind rattled the windows.  

**Questions:**  
1. How is Emma feeling?  
2. Which words give you clues?  
3. Why do you think the author describes the weather in this way?  

---

## Part E: Create Your Own  
Write one sentence that shows (but doesn’t say) each emotion:  

- Nervous _______________________________________  
- Angry _________________________________________  
- Excited ________________________________________  
- Sad ___________________________________________

## 📝 Answer Key (Teacher Use Only)

**Part A**  
1. Nervous/ashamed – “shuffled feet,” “stared at the floor.”  
2. Annoyed/unwilling – “muttered,” “crossing her arms.”  
3. Impatient/anxious – “checked the clock,” “tapped fingers.”  

**Part B**  
1. Mia is scared/nervous – “hands trembled,” “glancing over her shoulder.”  
2. James is angry/frustrated – “slammed his book,” “stomped out.”  
3. Puppy is happy/excited – “wagged tail furiously,” “bouncing,” “licking.”  

**Part C**  
1. She might be full, upset, or unwell – text suggests hidden reason.  
2. He is cold or it’s windy – “pulled coat tighter,” “hurried.”  

**Part D**  
1. Emma is anxious or frightened.  
2. “Pulled her blanket tighter,” “bit her lip,” “wind rattled.”  
3. Stormy weather reflects her fear, creating tension (pathetic fallacy).  

**Part E** – open-ended (teacher checks for inference through clues, not direct statements).
